my work from Writing a Simple Operating System â€” from Scratch by nick blundell 

# Compilation
  make sure to have 'nasm' installed and then run;
  ```sh
  make
  ```
  
# Running
  You can use Qemu, Bochs or a VMM like VirtualBox(using the .img file). For example here is 
  how you would run an image with qemu(i386);
  ```sh
  qemu-system-i386 3_4_4_using_stack.bin
  ```
